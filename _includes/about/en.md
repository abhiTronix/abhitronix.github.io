I'm **Abhishek Singh Thakur** a.k.a *@abhiTronix* - a visionary engineer, developer and passionate researcher. Since childhood, I have been fascinated with the intelligent robots in video games and movies and their colossal power inspired me to create something similiar. In order to realize this goal, i’m currently exploiting existing open-source libraries and resources in the field of Robotics and Artificial-Intelligence (Deep Learning/ Computer Vision/ Machine Learning). A few of my such creations are:
